# DoorInterfaceControl

This application I built to interface with our Isoans Pure Access Manager Door system.  
The Isonas software is on a server local to our network.  

Isonas has documentation on its API calls.  This application follows their V1 API.  Isonas also has Pure Access Cloud system which is hosted and uses a V2 API.  This application pulls in all the doors in the system displays the MAC Address, Reader type, Door State (e.g. Propped Open) , and Door Unlock State (Locked or Unlocked). 
I added buttons to unlock all the doors in case of a fire, also added a button to return the system to normal.  Then you can check individual doors (1 or more) and change the status.

The status changes are Admit which sets the door to unlock just like a keyfob read then lock again.  
Lockdown which sets the door to a lockdown status and only master keyfobs can unlock the door.  
Schedule which returns the door to is normal state based on the schedule set in the system.  
Unlock which permanently unlocks the door until another state is applied to the door or midnight   
when a schedule is published.

I have locked it down to AD groups that match either IT or HR.  That way only people that control the Door system can use this application. 

This application is build on MVVM model using [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism "Prism Library").    
It will require Prism to be added to your programming environment.  

Feel free to take the code and modify it to fit your needs.  All I ask is give me credit and point people
to my github location.
